# LED Grid Game System ðŸŽ®ðŸ’¡

This project implements interactive games playable on a 3x3 touch grid with LED feedback. Each game features distinct animations, colors, and gameplay logicâ€”optimized for microcontroller environments such as a Raspberry Pi with NeoPixels and an MPR121 touch sensor.

## Contents

- `main.py` â€” Central launcher to switch between games
- `hardware.py` â€” Initialization of touch sensor and LED strip
- `animations.py` â€” Visual effects and utility functions
- `config.py` â€” Constants like colors, mappings, and win conditions
- `game_simon.py` â€” Simon Says game with a color sequence
- `game_tictactoe.py` â€” Two-player Tic Tac Toe

---

## Games

### Simon Says

Repeat the color sequence shown on the grid. Each round adds a new color. How long can you keep up?

### Tic Tac Toe

Two players take turns marking the grid. The first to align three colors in a row, column, or diagonal wins!

##  Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi (or compatible board)
- NeoPixel LED strip (9 LEDs)
- Adafruit MPR121 Capacitive Touch Sensor
- Connected via I2C
- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `adafruit-circuitpython-mpr121`
  - `adafruit-circuitpython-neopixel`
  - `keyboard` (desktop only, for key input)

---

## Controls

### Via keyboard:
- `1` â†’ Start Tic Tac Toe
- `2` â†’ Start Simon Says
- `Esc` â†’ Exit the program

---

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install adafruit-circuitpython-mpr121 adafruit-circuitpython-neopixel keyboard
   ```

2. Launch the system:
   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

3. Use the keyboard to switch between games.
